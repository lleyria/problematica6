Version 1.0.1 Code and samples of the html structure and js logic of the sixth "Problematica Semanal" from the Become a software developer course. In this exercise I recreate the famous game called Snake using the html canvas tool and following the instruction of the tutorial provided by Radium Rocket. After that I create a new element of the game that provides extra points and doesn't make the snake any bigger. I use fetch API to upload the actual score to a fictional server at the moment of "eating" this recently created element. If the score is succesfully upload (.then) the console will show a success message otherwise (.catch) will show an error. One of the determinate things in which I focused was the internalization of the so called "Buenas Pr√°cticas" of the java script logial lenguage. These good practices suchs as proxily, coherence and adaptability are not strictly requiered to be a programer but neccesary to be a good programer and make individual and group, work more efficient.
